## Known Limitations

1. **Performance**
   - Heavy computing on initial chunk generation
   - No LOD system yet (all chunk details rendered equally)
   - No texture mapping (vertex colors only)

2. **Gameplay**
   - No inventory management (only 9 quick slots)
   - No survival mechanics (health/hunger)
   - No creative mode alternatives
   - Simple terrain generation (no caves/structures)

3. **Graphics**
   - No advanced lighting (limited to ambient + directional)
   - No shadow quality options
   - Simplified water rendering
   - No particle system optimization

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Performance Testing**
   - Test with different render distances
   - Monitor memory usage over time
   - Check FPS consistency

2. **Gameplay Testing**
   - Test block placement/destruction in various situations
   - Verify collision detection edge cases
   - Test terrain generation edge cases
   - Verify all 9 block types work correctly

3. **Visual Testing**
   - Check day/night cycle smoothness
   - Verify particle effects
   - Test water rendering
   - Confirm UI visibility

## Configuration Guide

Edit `config.json` to customize:
- Render distance (default: 8 chunks)
- Player speed and movement (default: 0.1)
- Jump power and gravity (default: 0.5, 0.02)
- Terrain parameters (height range, water level, etc.)
- Graphics settings (shadow map size, particle limit)
- Audio settings (volume, effects on/off)

## Debugging

### Enable Debug Display
Press F3 to toggle debug information overlay

### Check Console
Open browser DevTools (F12) console for error messages

### Common Issues
- Low FPS: Reduce render distance or check system resources
- Chunks not loading: Check browser console for errors
- No sound: Verify browser audio permissions
- Visual glitches: Try different browser or update graphics drivers
